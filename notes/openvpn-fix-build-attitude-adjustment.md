It is not clear what I did that night when trying to get the LuCI application for openvpn configured and built.  But to the bes of my recollection it went something like this.

In general the luci-app-openvpn was available, but not showing up in menuconfig and the patch was used to hand apply changes to the core package to get it going.  A copy of the patch is provided to reconstruct the fix.
